This tutorial shows you how to get and modify the user's profile data with Auth0 in your Android apps.

## Before You Start

::: note
Before you continue with this tutorial, make sure that you have completed the [Login](/quickstart/native/android/00-login) and [Session Handling](/quickstart/native/android/03-session-handling) tutorials. To call the API clients, you need a valid access token and id token.
:::

Before launching the login process, you need to make sure you get a valid profile from the authorization server. To do that, ask for the `openid profile email` scope. Find the snippet in which you initialize the `WebAuthProvider` class. To that snippet, add the line `withScope("openid profile email")`.

```java
Auth0 auth0 = new Auth0(this);
auth0.setOIDCConformant(true);
WebAuthProvider.init(auth0)
                .withScheme("demo")
                .withScope("openid profile email")
                .start(this, callback);
```

## Request User Data


To get the user's information:
1. Use the user's access token to call the `userInfo` method in the `AuthenticationAPIClient` client instance.
The profile obtained this way is OIDC-conformant. Depending on the [scopes](/scopes/current) you requested when logging in, the profile contains different information. The result will never contain fields outside the OIDC specification.
2. Get the user's full profile using the [Management API](/api/management/v2#!/Users). This step is explained next:


Create an instance of the Users API client using the id token that you saved in the log in step. In the snippet bellow we obtain it from the extras that the LoginActivity class has passed when starting this activity. The API client is used to request the users' profile data.

```java
// app/src/main/java/com/auth0/samples/activities/MainActivity.java

Auth0 auth0 = new Auth0(this);
auth0.setOIDCConformant(true);

String idToken = getIntent().getStringExtra(LoginActivity.KEY_ID_TOKEN);
UsersAPIClient usersClient = new UsersAPIClient(auth0, idToken);
```

::: note
Do not hardcode the Auth0 `domain` and `clientId` values when creating the Auth0 instance. We recommend you add them to the `strings.xml` file.
:::


Decode the id token using a [JWT library](https://github.com/auth0/JWTDecode.Android) and obtain the Subject value, which represents the id of the user to whom the token was issued.

```java
// app/src/main/java/com/auth0/samples/activities/MainActivity.java

private String getUserId(String idToken) {
    return new JWT(idToken).getSubject();
}
```

Use the user id to call `getProfile` on the Users API client and obtain the full user profile. Use the received data to update the layout.

```java
// app/src/main/java/com/auth0/samples/activities/MainActivity.java

usersClient.getProfile(getUserId(idToken))
  .start(new BaseCallback<UserProfile, ManagementException>() {
      @Override
      public void onSuccess(UserProfile profile) {
        // Display the user profile
      }

      @Override
      public void onFailure(ManagementException error) {
        // Show error
      }
  });
```

## Access the Data Inside the Received Profile

### Default information

At this point, you already have access to the `UserProfile` instance.
You can use this data wherever you need it.

Some examples are:

```java
profile.getName();
profile.getEmail();
profile.getPictureURL();
```

::: panel Modifying the UI
You cannot modify the UI inside the callback methods as they run in a different thread. To solve this issue you can choose between three options:
* Persist the data and then retrieve it
* Create a task in the UI thread and run it. i.e. using the `Activity#runOnUiThread` method.
* Create a `Handler` to post the information
:::

### Additional information

You can handle additional information within any of the following maps:

#### A. User metadata

The `userMetadata` map contains user profile fields that can be added from the client-side (e.g. when a user edits their profile). You can access this information in the following way:

```java
String country = (String) profile.getUserMetadata().get("country");
```

::: note
You can choose the key names and value types for subscripting the `user_metadata` map.
:::

#### B. App metadata

The `appMetadata` map contains fields that are usually added with a [Rule](/rules) or a [Hook](/hooks). For native platforms, this information is read-only.

::: note
To learn more about metadata, see the [metadata documentation](/metadata).
:::

#### C. Extra information

The `extraInfo` map contains additional values that are stored in Auth0 but not mapped to a `UserProfile` getter method. For native platforms, this information is read-only.

## Update the User's Profile

You can only update the user metadata. To do this, create a `Map<String, Object>` object and add the information you want to store.

```java
Map<String, Object> userMetadata = new HashMap<>();
userMetadata.put("country", "USA");
```

Update the information with the User API client:

```java
// app/src/main/java/com/auth0/samples/activities/MainActivity.java

UsersAPIClient usersClient = new UsersAPIClient(auth0, idToken);
usersClient.updateMetadata(userInfo.getId(), userMetadata).start(new BaseCallback<UserProfile, ManagementException>() {
  @Override
  public void onSuccess(final UserProfile profile) {
    // As receive the updated profile here
    // You can react to this, and show the information to the user.
  }

  @Override
  public void onFailure(ManagementException error) {
    //show error
  }
});
```


::: note
A call to `updateMetadata` will replace any previous user metadata stored in Auth0. Remember to copy the old values that you wish to maintain.
